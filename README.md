# Particle Tests

A quick project to investigate multitouch


## npm scripts

* `npm start` - Build and start the app in development mode at http://localhost:8080
* `npm run build` - Run a production build, outputs to ./build/
* `npm run lint` - Lint your code

## Removing the bootstrapped files
It's as easy as removing all the child folders in ./app/ then emptying app.js.
